  <p> David Schwimmer as Ross Geller, is a paleontologist at a museum of prehistory, and later a professor of paleontology at New York University. The most intelligent of the six main characters, but at the same time a clumsy, quirky man, Ross is known for being a know-it-all who prides himself on his rationality, despite his clear hopeless romanticism. Monica's older brother, Chandler's college roommate, and Rachel's on-again, off-again boyfriend, Ross has three failed marriages during the series (including a drunken marriage to Rachel in Las Vegas) and is involved in an on-and-off relationship with Rachel, which is a main storyline throughout the series. He is also the father of his ex-wife Carol's son, Ben, and Rachel's daughter, Emma. In the series finale, Ross and Rachel finally reconcile, deciding to be together once and for all. It's revealed in the first episode of Joey that Ross and Rachel have married again.<p>
