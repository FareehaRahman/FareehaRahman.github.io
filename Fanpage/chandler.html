    <p> Matthew Perry as Chandler Bing, is an executive in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration for a large multi-national corporation,
      a job which he despises. Because of this, Chandler later quits his job and becomes a junior copywriter at an advertising agency. Chandler
      is known for his sarcastic sense of humor. An intelligent man at the end of the day (despite all his goofy quirkiness), he often mocks his
      best friend Joey for the latter's stupidity. Chandler is often depicted as being somewhat of a hapless individual, suffering a lot of bad
      luck while struggling through life and occasionally struggling with an on-and-off smoking addiction. He dated the well-known nasal character
      Janice who annoyed everyone and eventually aggravated Chandler. However, he eventually falls in deep mutual love with Monica; an emotional
      Chandler tells her that she "makes him happier than he ever thought he could be" while proposing to her at the close of season six, with the two of them marrying at the close of season seven. By the end of the series, he and Monica adopt twins, whom they name Jack and Erica.<p>
