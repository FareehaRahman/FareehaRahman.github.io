    <p> Matt Le Blanc as Joey Tribbiani, is a good-natured but not-so-bright struggling actor and food lover,
			who becomes mildly famous for his role as Dr. Drake Ramoray on a fictionalized version of Days of Our Lives.
			 Joey is a womanizer, with many girlfriends throughout the series, often using his catchphrase pick-up line
			 "How you doin'?" He develops a crush on Rachel in season eight but nothing happens until Rachel falls for
			 Joey at the end of season nine. They date for about a week, becoming official in Barbados but they end the
			 relationship because they can never be more than best friends. Matt Le Blanc got a spin off show called Joey
			 once the series finished because Joey's character didn't have a resolute ending.<p>
